Many thanks to the following people and projects for sharing their great work, upon which a lot of this was based!

-   Many thanks to Pavel Spirhanzl and Alexandre Pajak for their keen eyes in identifying bugs in early versions.
-   Gary Bernhardt's [Text Editor From Scratch](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/text-editor-from-scratch) screencast.
-   Anthony Sottile's [babi](https://github.com/asottile/babi/).
-   [nano](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/nano.git/tree/) source.
-   [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) source. In my opinion, the best way to explore the source is through Emacs' built-in help commands.
